# Product Manifesto

💾 Every company is a tech company.

✨ You really need design way more than you think.

🎯 Always know what problem you're solving and for whom. Always go back to this.

🔒 Information security and user privacy is everones's problem.

❤️ Never assume malice. Practice empathy.

📃 Share information freely and try to document the things you do.

👭 Bring stakeholders along for the ride.

🔥 Never place blame. That includes yourself. Rather, aim to learn.

🚀 A growth mindset is everything.

✂️ YAGNI. Ruthlessly prioritise.
